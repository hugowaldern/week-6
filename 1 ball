//set upso one circle would run. repeated stroke ran with the directional

//added no stroke and a backround, can no longer see circle so i added a
//fill on the ellipse, made corder a ractangle to add more surface bounce. 
//changing of the size made the bounary non existant. 
//rewrote if statements conforming boiundaries. 
//added second circle rewriting under separate code sets.
